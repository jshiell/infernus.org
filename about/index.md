## Me, Myself, and I

I'm James Shiell. To pay the bills I write software and manage software developers. For fun, I write code; experiment with my home; play computer and board games; and have a dangerous taste for chewy stouts. I'm located near London, where I live with my partner and dog.

## Contact

There's [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jsh), where I also occasionally post. And there's always [email](mailto:www+infernus@infernus.org).

I'm also on [GitHub](https://github.com/jshiell).

This is a very boring website. It doesn't track you in any way beyond the default web server logs generated by the default configuration. There aren't any ads or cookies, and if you're seeing some you probably need to audit your web browser.
