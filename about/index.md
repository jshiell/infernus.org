I'm James Shiell. To pay the bills I write software and manage software developers. I'm located near London, where I live with my partner and dog.

For my sins, I wrote and more-or-less maintain [the CheckStyle plugin for IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/jshiell/checkstyle-idea/).

You can find some of my various computer scribblings on [GitHub](https://github.com/jshiell/), or the more human-oriented ones on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jsh), occasionally at least. Or there's always [email](mailto:www+infernus@infernus.org).
