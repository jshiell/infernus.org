This marks the start of a slow resurrection of my blog, driven mostly by annoyance with over-centralisation combined with irritation from those who make dubious pitches that this needs, surprise, another technological solution, ideally using the blockchain they have an interest in. Alas, it turns out we have the technology and the problem is, as always, us.

There's not a lot here yet, but hopefully that will change. There are no guarantees, of course.
